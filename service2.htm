<p class="yellow">
	(F1) Originating from the Caribbean, Mexico, and Central America, less so in Florida countries, this is a rather common orchid and grows in the southern swamps where it is protected from the extreme cold weather by the water nearby. Plants typically grow on small branches and twigs on the periphery of various hardwoods in these swamps, where their small fans of almost succulent leaves hold on to their host by slender white roots.
	Their branching panicles of flowers emerge from an axil between the leaves, bearing many small (1 cm) snowflake-like flowers. Plants can bloom for many months and even after the main blooming is over, they can produce additional blooming stems from inactive nodes.<br><br><br><br>

<a href="services.htm" accesskey="2" title="Services link"><img src="images/BirdOfParadiseFlowers.jpg" alt="Bird Of Paradise Flowers.jpg" /></a>
	(F3) Pollinated by sunbirds in South Africa this is commonly known as a crane flower. A common name of the genus is Bird of Paradise Flower; this is because of a supposed resemblance of its flowers to the bird of paradise. This species S. Nicolai is the largest in the genus reaching over 10 meters tall with gorgeous stately white and blue flowers. Its leaves are very large at 30cm – 200cm long and 10cm - 80cm broad, this makes it very similar to a banana leaf in appearance but with a longer petiole. These flowers are produced in a horizontal inflorescence; they start growing from the stout spathe and are arranged strictly in two ranks which form a crown of evergreen foliage in a fan like manner to look truly amazing.<br><br><br><br>
